# Istio License Generation Guide

## Usage

Note: This tool requires <https://github.com/benbalter/licensee> for --summary and --match_detail to work.
The --branch flag is only used in generating links to licenses in the appropriate branch in istio/istio.
Licenses under manual_append have been manually copied and OK'd (usually because the package source only
contains a link).

- Generate complete dump of every license, suitable for including in release build/binary image

    ```
    go run main.go --branch release-1.0.1
    ```

- CSV format output with one package per line:

    ```
    go run main.go --summary --branch release-1.0.1
    ```

- Detailed info about how closely each license matches official text:

    ```
    go run main.go --match-detail --branch release-1.0.1
    ```

- Use a different branch from the current one. Will do git checkout to that branch and back to the current on completion. This can only be used from inside Istio repo:

    ```
    go run main.go --branch release-1.0.1 --checkout
    ```

- Check if all licenses are Google approved. Outputs lists of restricted, reciprocal, missing, and unknown status licenses.

    ```
    go run main.go --check
    ```
