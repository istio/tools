# Test description

This is a TLS egress gateway SDS test.
The test sets up a number of TLS egress gateways for a group of nginx services.
The test creates a group of sleep pods, where each sleep sends HTTP requests to a nginx
service periodically. For example, sleep-1 sends HTTP requests to my-nginx-1,
and sleep-2 sends HTTPS requests to my-nginx-2.example.com. The sleep pods are deployed in clientns and nginx are deployed
in a namespace called mesh-external".

## To run the SDS test originating mTLS at gateway

- Create a GKE cluster and set it as the current cluster.
Here this test is run on the cluster *istio-testing*
on GCP project *istio-security-testing*.
You may use `kubectl config current-context` to confirm that your newly created cluster
is set as the current cluster.

- Deploy Istio:
  istio-egressgateway must be enabled!

- Deploy workloads that request for certificates through SDS.
*NUM* variable specifies the number of TLS gateway and client workloads. For example, `NUM=100` will
create 100 TLS egress gateway and 100 egress secrets, and 100 sleep workloads as clients.
*CLUSTER* variable specifies the cluster for running the test
(the list of clusters can be viewed through "kubectl config get-contexts").
The following example command will deploy a test namespace, with 100 TLS gateway and 100 sleep workloads in
the namespace.
Note: the number of workloads can be ran depends on the size of your cluster.

    ```bash
    NUM=100 CLUSTER=gke_istio-security-testing_us-central1-a_istio-testing ./setup_test.sh
    ```

The log in sleep container shows number of requests sent to nginx and number of successful responses.

To download a specific version of istioctl and deploy the test worloads using that istioctl binary.

    ```bash
    NUM=100 CLUSTER=gke_istio-security-testing_us-central1-a_istio-testing ./setup_test.sh 1.5.1 pre-release
    ```

To cleanup the setup with NUM of deployments use the following command:

    ```bash
    NUM=100 CLUSTER=gke_istio-security-testing_us-central1-a_istio-testing ./cleanup.sh
    ```
