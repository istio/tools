Basically, this Istio Performance Dashboard is built on top of Python Web [Django Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), which is a typical MVC pattern.

In Django, MVC is corresponding to:
- `models.py` file is the `model`
- `template` is the `view`
- `views.py` file is the `controller`

### Project Components

- The `perf_dashboard/perf_dashboard` repo contains all project-level settings, views and urls, which is using `perf_dashboard/templates` to render the home page.
- All there other sidebar sections you can see in this application is created by `python manage.py startapp [app_name]`. Like currently, we have the following apps:
    - benchmarks
    - regression_alerts
    - artifacts
