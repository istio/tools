# Tratis

Tratis (**tr**acing **to** **is**otope) convert distributed tracing traces
into isotope configuration files so that developers and users can
model realistic applications.

Tratis will take as input, traces generated by distributed tracing tools for
service mesh type applications (Jaeger, Zipkin), and be able to capture

1. Application Call Order (Dependency Graph, Call Order) AS a n-ary tree.
2. Request Processing Times AS known distributions.

Currently Tratis only supports applications which don't have a dynamic
call graph i.e. the call graph remains the same for each request.
